SignalR.ConnectionManager
=========================

A .NET SignalR Client Connection Manager to automatically resume and keep up connections to SignalR servers in unstable network environments like mobile clients.

This is currently work in progress. I am still stabilizing the code for the first release. Subscription functionality still missing. Currently only remote function invokes are working.
